        <h2>I. A brief summary</h2>
            <p>Fullmetal Alchemist (Japanese: 鋼の錬金術師) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa, later adapted into two anime versions in 2003 and 2009 respectively. </p>
            <p> Brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric are raised by their mother Trisha Elric in the remote village of Resembool in the country of Amestris. Their father Hohenheim, a noted and very gifted alchemist, abandoned his family while the boys were still young, and while in Trisha's care they began to show an affinity for alchemy and became curious about its secrets. However, when Trisha died of a lingering illness, they were cared for by their best friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako. The boys traveled the world to advance their alchemic training under Izumi Curtis. Upon returning home, <u>the two decide to try to bring their mother back to life with alchemy.</u> <mark>However, human transmutation is a taboo, as it is impossible to do so properly.</mark> In the failed transmutation, <mark>Al's body is completely obliterated, and Ed loses his left leg.</mark> In a last attempt to keep his brother alive, <u>Ed sacrifices his right arm to bring Al's soul back and binds it to a nearby suit of armor.</u> After Edward receives automail prosthetics from Winry and Pinako, the brothers burn down their house, symbolizing their determination and decision of <em>"no turning back"</em>, and head to the capital city to become government-sanctioned State Alchemists. After passing the exam, Edward is dubbed the <mark>"Fullmetal Alchemist"</mark> by the State Military, and the brothers begin their quest to regain their full bodies back through the fabled Philosopher's Stone under the direction of <mark>Colonel Roy Mustang</mark>. Along the way, they discover a deep government conspiracy to hide the true nature of the Philosopher's Stone that involves the homunculi, the alchemists of the neighboring nation of Xing, the scarred man from the war-torn nation of Ishval, and their own father's past.</p>

        <h2>III. Reasons why I love FMA</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Rich character relationships <br> The series is famous for its dynamic relationships that resonate with us audience. For example, the bond between Edward and Alphonse Elric is central to the story, showcasing themes of brotherhood and sacrifice. Their unwavering support for each other drives the narrative, making their struggles relatable and emotionally impactful. Them helping each other when facing challenges teaches me to face my own obstacles in life. Also, the friendship between Roy Mustang and Maes Hughes highlights loyalty and the pain of loss, especially evident during Hughes' tragic death, which deeply affects Mustang and showcases the emotional stakes involved.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Complex moral questions <br> Fullmetal Alchemist delves into ethical dilemmas surrounding alchemy and the pursuit of knowledge. The consequences of human transmutation, as experienced by Edward and Alphonse when they try to bring their mother back to life, raise questions about the morality of playing God and the limits of science. My mind goes on a journey of exploring life morals as I view them struggling to make difficult choices from time to time. It's an amazing experience.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Engaging Plot Twists <br> The series is filled with unexpected plot twists that keep us audiences on our toes. For example, characters like Greed and Ling develop complex relationships that evolve throughout the story, leading to numerous moments that challenge my expectations about loyalty and self-identity. The complicated web of conspiracies involving the homunculi and their ties to the main characters adds layers to the narrative, keeping me invested in the unfolding drama. </li>
